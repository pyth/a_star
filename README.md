## How to run
You can run this script with Python 2 or 3. You need to have the *enum* and *tkinter* modules installed.

To start, press the space bar on your keyboard.


## Explanation
Once you run the script, you will see a field filled with squares of different colors:
* All but two squares are a shade of gray. The darker a square, the harder it is to move through it.
* The *red* square is the start
* The *green* square is the goal.
* The *yellow* squares have at some point been considered as the next step towards the goal.
* The *cyan* squares are show the best path found.
